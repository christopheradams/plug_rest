# PlugRest

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/christopheradams/plug_rest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/christopheradams/plug_rest)
[![Hex Version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/plug_rest.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/plug_rest)

An Elixir port of Cowboy's REST sub-protocol for Plug applications.

PlugRest has two main components:

* `PlugRest.Router` - supplements Plug's router with a `resource` macro,
  which matches a URL path with a Plug module for all HTTP methods
* `PlugRest.Resource` - defines a behaviour for Plug modules to
  represent web resources declaratively using multiple callbacks

PlugRest is perfect for creating well-behaved and semantically correct
hypermedia web applications.

## Introduction

### Hello World

Define a router to match a path with a resource handler:

```elixir
defmodule MyRouter do
  use PlugRest.Router

  plug :match
  plug :dispatch

  resource "/hello", HelloResource
end
```

Define the resource handler and implement the optional callbacks:

```elixir
defmodule HelloResource do
  use PlugRest.Resource

  def to_html(conn, state) do
    {"Hello world", conn, state}
  end
end
```

## Features

#### Router

  - Route all requests for a path to a plug, for any HTTP method

#### Resource

  - Built-in HEAD and OPTIONS responses, and easy handling of GET,
    POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests
  - Content negotiation for media types, languages, and charsets
  - HTTP access authentication
  - Observance of etag, expires, last-modified, and vary headers
  - Multiple choices for redirects, not modified responses, etc.
  - Correct HTTP status codes for common 400 and 500 level errors

## Why PlugRest?

> The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. <br/>
> â€”Roy Fielding

In the REST architectural style, one of the uniform interface
constraints is the identification of resources. Using
[Plug](https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug), we can satisfy this
requirement by routing requests based on a URL path.

PlugRest goes a step further. Rather than manually defining HTTP
semantics for each route and dividing a resource's behavior over
multiple controller actions, PlugRest lets us describe our resources
in a declarative way (by implementing callbacks), and follows protocol
for us, including returning the correct status code when something
goes wrong (or right).

PlugRest can help your Elixir application become a fluent speaker of
the HTTP protocol. It can assist with content negotiation, cache
headers, basic authentication, and redirects. However, it is not a
full-featured framework with views, templates, sessions, or web
sockets. It also lacks a requisite solution for hypermedia controls,
which are essential to REST.

PlugRest is not the first REST-based framework to take a
resource-oriented approach. Basho's
[Webmachine](https://github.com/webmachine/webmachine) has inspired
many such libraries, including cowboy_rest.

You can use PlugRest in a standalone web app or as part of an existing
Phoenix application. Details below!


## Installation

If starting a new project, generate a supervisor application:

```sh
$ mix new my_app --sup
$ cd my_app
```

Add PlugRest to your project in two steps:

1. Add `:cowboy`, `:plug`, and `:plug_rest` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:cowboy, "~> 1.0.0"},
       {:plug, "~> 1.4"},
       {:plug_rest, "~> 0.13"}]
    end
    ```

2. Add these dependencies to your applications list:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:cowboy, :plug, :plug_rest]]
    end
    ```

Install the dependencies by running `mix deps.get` and `mix deps.compile`.

## Getting Started

### Resources

Create a file at `lib/my_app/resources/hello_resource.ex` to hold your Resource
Handler:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.HelloResource do
  use PlugRest.Resource

  def allowed_methods(conn, state) do
    {["HEAD", "GET", "OPTIONS"], conn, state}
  end

  def content_types_provided(conn, state) do
    {[{"text/html", :to_html}], conn, state}
  end

  def to_html(conn, state) do
    {"Hello #{state}", conn, state}
  end
end
```

### Router

Create a file at `lib/my_app/router.ex` to hold the Router:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Router do
  use PlugRest.Router
  use Plug.ErrorHandler

  plug :match
  plug :dispatch

  resource "/hello", MyApp.HelloResource, "World"

  match "/match" do
    send_resp(conn, 200, "Match")
  end
end
```

The PlugRest Router adds a `resource` macro which accepts a URL path,
a Plug module, and its options. If the module is a `PlugRest.Resource`,
it will begin executing the REST callbacks, passing in any initial
`state` given to it.

The router contains a plug pipeline and requires two plugs: `match`
and `dispatch`. You can add custom plugs into this pipeline.

You can also use the `match` macros from `Plug.Router`.
This provides an escape hatch to bypass the REST mechanism for a
particular route and send a Plug response manually.

If no routes match, PlugRest will send a response with a `404` status
code to the client automatically.

#### Dynamic path segments

Router paths can have segments that match URLs dynamically:

```elixir
resource "/users/:id", MyApp.UserResource
```

The path parameters can be accessed in your resource in `conn.params`:

```elixir
def to_html(%{params: params} = conn, state) do
  user_id = params["id"]
  {"Hello #{user_id}", conn, state}
end
```

### Application

Finally, add the Router to your supervision tree by editing
`lib/my_app.ex`:

```elixir
# Define workers and child supervisors to be supervised
children = [
  Plug.Adapters.Cowboy.child_spec(:http, MyApp.Router, [], [port: 4001])
]
```

### Running

Compile your application and then run it:

```sh
$ mix compile
$ iex -S mix
```

Your server will be running and the resource will be available at
`http://localhost:4001/hello`.

### Tasks

You can generate a new PlugRest resource (with all of the callbacks
implemented) by using a Mix task:

```sh
$ mix plug_rest.gen.resource UserResource
```

The task will create a resource at `lib/my_app/resources/user_resource.ex`.

### Callbacks

The `PlugRest.Resource` module defines dozens of callbacks that offer
a declarative strategy for defining a resource's behavior. Implement
your desired callbacks and let this library *do the REST*, including
returning the appropriate response headers and status code.

Each callback takes two arguments:

* `conn` - a `%Plug.Conn{}` struct; use this to fetch details about
  the request (see the Plug docs for more info)
* `state` - the state of the Resource; use this to store any data that
  should be available to subsequent callbacks

Each callback must return a three-element tuple of the form `{value,
conn, state}`. All callbacks are optional, and will be given default
values if you do not define them. Some of the most common and useful
callbacks are shown below with their defaults:

      allowed_methods        : ["GET", "HEAD", "OPTIONS"]
      content_types_accepted : none
      content_types_provided : [{{"text/html"}, :to_html}]
      expires                : nil
      forbidden              : false
      generate_etag          : nil
      is_authorized          : true
      last_modified          : nil
      malformed_request      : false
      moved_permanently      : false
      moved_temporarily      : false
      resource_exists        : true

The [docs](https://hexdocs.pm/plug_rest/PlugRest.Resource.html)
for `PlugRest.Resource` list all of the supported REST callbacks and
their default values.

### Content Negotiation

#### Content Types Provided

You can return representations of your resource in different formats
by implementing the `content_types_provided` callback, which pairs
each content-type with a handler function:

```elixir
def content_types_provided(conn, state) do
  {[{"text/html", :to_html},
    {"application/json", :to_json}], conn, state}
end

def to_html(conn, state) do
  {"<h1>Hello</h1>", conn, state}
end

def to_json(conn, state) do
  {"{\"title\": \"Hello\"}", conn, state}
end
```

#### Content Types Accepted

Similarly, you can accept different media types from clients by
implementing the `content_types_accepted` callback:

```elixir
def content_types_accepted(conn, state) do
  {[{"mixed/multipart", :from_multipart},
    {"application/json", :from_json}], conn, state}
    end

def from_multipart(conn, state) do
  # fetch or read the request body params, update the database, etc.
  {true, conn, state}
end

def from_json(conn, state) do
  {true, conn, state}
end
```

The content handler functions you implement can return either `true`,
`{true, URL}` (for redirects), or `false` (for errors). Don't forget
to add "POST", "PUT", and/or "PATCH" to your resource's list of
`allowed_methods`.

Consult the `Plug.Conn` and `Plug.Parsers` docs for information on
parsing and reading the request body params.

### Testing

Use `Plug.Test` to help verify your resource's responses to separate
requests. Create a file at `test/resources/hello_resource_test.exs` to
hold your test:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.HelloResourceTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  use Plug.Test

  alias MyApp.Router

  test "get hello resource" do
    conn = conn(:get, "/hello")

    conn = Router.call(conn, [])

    assert conn.status == 200
    assert conn.resp_body == "Hello world"
  end
end
```

Run the test with:

```sh
$ mix test
```

### Debugging

To help debug your app during development, add `Plug.Debugger` to the
top of the router, before `use Plug.ErrorHandler`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Router do
  use PlugRest.Router

  if Mix.env == :dev do
    use Plug.Debugger, otp_app: :my_app
  end

  use Plug.ErrorHandler

  # ...
end
```

### Error Handling

By adding `use Plug.ErrorHandler` to your router, you will ensure it
returns correct HTTP status codes when plugs raise exceptions. To set
a custom error response, add the `handle_errors/2` callback to your
router:

```elixir
defp handle_errors(conn, %{kind: _kind, reason: _reason, stack: _stack}) do
  send_resp(conn, conn.status, "Something went wrong")
end
```


### Phoenix

You can use PlugRest's router and resources in your Phoenix app like
any other plug by forwarding requests to them:

```elixir
forward "/rest", HelloPhoenix.RestRouter
```

To get the `resource` macro directly in your Phoenix router, use
[PhoenixRest](https://github.com/christopheradams/phoenix_rest/).
